<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin creates a toolbar on JetBrains products (IntelliJ, PyCharm, ...)
where you can view GitHub workflow runs of the repository.
This plugin is a good alternative to alt-tabbing for every time you push
some changes to the branch and want to see whether the repository's checks
are passing on your changes.
